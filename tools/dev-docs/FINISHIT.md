# tools/dev-docs/FINISHIT.md

1. **Purpose**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   FinishIt is the standardized workflow for:
   - finalizing active feature work
   - committing completed implementation
   - pushing existing feature branches
   - creating pull requests

   When the user says:
   - "finishit"
   - "ready to commit and pr"

   the assistant should:
   - assume implementation is already complete
   - assume the user is already on the correct branch
   - prepare commit + PR workflow
   </pre>

1. **Expected Repository State**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   Expected:
   - existing GitHub issue already exists
   - branch already exists
   - implementation already completed
   - user already checked out to feature branch

   The assistant should:
   - verify current branch
   - verify git status
   - avoid creating duplicate branches/issues
   </pre>

1. **Critical Workflow Rules**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   NEVER during FinishIt workflow:
   - git checkout main
   - git pull origin main
   - git checkout -b ...
   - create duplicate issue
   - commit directly to main

   These commands belong ONLY to ChangeIt workflows.

   FinishIt assumes:
   - active implementation branch already exists
   - work is already in progress or complete
   </pre>

1. **Command Output Rules**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   When generating terminal commands:

   - ALWAYS use plain fenced markdown code blocks
   - Prefer ```bash fenced blocks
   - NEVER use writing blocks for terminal commands
   - NEVER interleave commentary inside command blocks
   - Output must be directly copy/paste safe for Git Bash
   </pre>

1. **Assistant Responsibilities**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   The assistant should:
   - generate commit messages
   - generate PR titles
   - generate PR descriptions
   - recommend pytest before commit
   - use current branch automatically
   - push current branch
   - create PR into main
   - avoid modifying branch topology
   - beep 3 times once the PR is open (see "PR-Ready Signal" below)
   </pre>

1. **Commit Subject Format**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   All commit subjects (first line) MUST follow:

   <type>(<epicAbbrev>): <shortDescription>

   type:             feat | fix | docs | test | refactor | perf | build | chore
   epicAbbrev:       AUTH | GMAIL | PHOTOS | DRIVE | SRV | DOC (config/git/epics.txt
                      is the source of truth; docs/epics/README.md maps each code
                      to its epic)
   shortDescription: imperative mood, verb + noun

   Examples:
   - feat(GMAIL): add label-by-sender search helper
   - fix(AUTH): refresh expired token correctly
   - docs(DOC): document Google Cloud OAuth setup

   Merge commits and "Release vX.Y.Z" commits are exempt.

   Enforced locally by tools/git-hooks/commit-msg (run tools/git-hooks/install.sh
   once per clone -- .git/hooks/ isn't tracked by git). Branch names are enforced
   the same way by tools/git-hooks/pre-push.
   </pre>

1. **Canonical Workflow Template**
   <pre lang="bash">
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

   git status

   git add .

   if [ -f "pytest.ini" ] || [ -d "tests" ]; then
      pytest || exit 1
   else
      echo "No recognized test runner found. Skipping automated tests."
   fi

   git commit -m ""

   git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

   gh pr create \
     --base main \
     --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
     --title "" \
     --body "
   ## Summary
   - ...

   Closes #...
   "
   </pre>

1. **Optional Lightweight PR Variant**
   <pre lang="bash">
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

   git status

   git add .

   pytest || exit 1

   git commit -m ""

   git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

   gh pr create \
     --base main \
     --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
     --fill
   </pre>

1. **PR-Ready Signal**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   Once `gh pr create` succeeds, beep 3 times via PowerShell so the user
   notices without watching the terminal:

   [console]::beep(1000,300); Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 150; [console]::beep(1000,300); Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 150; [console]::beep(1000,300)

   Run it with the PowerShell tool, not Bash (no audio device access there).
   </pre>

1. **Post Merge Cleanup**
   <pre lang="bash">
   After the PR is merged, use POSTMERGE.md.
   </pre>

1. **Workflow Preferences**
   <pre lang="markdown">
   Prefer:
   - small focused commits
   - PR-friendly changes
   - passing tests before commit
   - clear Summary PR descriptions
   - current branch safety checks

   Avoid:
   - committing directly to main
   - branch switching during finalize workflow
   - creating duplicate issues
   - rebasing during finalization unless requested
   </pre>
